🏙️ City Management System (Java OOP Project)

📌 Project Description

The City Management System is a Java-based application developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. This system helps manage city-related information such as citizens and departments in an organized and efficient way.
The project demonstrates how OOP principles can be used to design scalable, maintainable, and modular software systems.

🎯 Objectives

To implement Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java
To manage citizen and department information
To design a modular and structured system
To demonstrate real-world application of Java OOP

🧠 OOP Concepts Used

This project uses the following OOP principles:
Encapsulation – Protecting data using private variables and public methods
Abstraction – Showing essential features and hiding implementation details
Inheritance – (Can be extended for future modules)
Polymorphism – (Can be implemented for method flexibility)
